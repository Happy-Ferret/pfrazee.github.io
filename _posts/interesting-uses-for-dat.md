[interesting properties of dat]

[usecase: software & cert distribution]

[usecase: search index & computed views]

so what Im thinking with the computed views could work that way or could be served from a live web api. Example would be a conversation thread. You could have a bunch of files across lots of dats, they all link to each other, your public peer indexes them and produces a .json of the full conversation

[usecase: derived dats]

just to have hyperdrives which content is basically just derived from another archive it follows

so fx, i could make a video converter service
pfrazee
yeah right, that could be a whole class of businesses
mafintosh
yea

or image scaling etc

[usecase: webhooks alternative]

so you could make another service that would make the dats archived searchable etc
mafintosh
or! just replicate the same dats

for redundancy
