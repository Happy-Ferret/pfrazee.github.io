## The Hacker's Web
<br>

To describe this idea fully, I'm going to employ a little story-telling. Here's a hypothetical slice of life in the hacker's web:

> "It would be nice to put a clock on that flat screen," you think. The screen is very visible to the office. It ought to be used for something. Why not a clock?

> You browse to a URL that you figure should exist: `app://time`. But, to your surprise, it's a 404! None of the hackers you follow have written an app there. None of the aggregators return a hit either. There isn't even a similar URL in use, like `app://clock`.

> "I'll put something together," you decide. A simple numeric view of the time. It's ugly, but it does the job. Why fret about the bells and whistles? You just need the time. You publish, and move on.

> A week later, you get a ding in `app://inbox`. Somebody forked the time app, and gave it some fonts! Ah, great. It looks much better. You switch to their version.

> Alice notices in her `app://feed` that you have a new time app, and she tries it out. She likes it too, but she thinks it's a bit simple. She posts in `app://requests` that the time app could use timezones - if anybody has the interest. And indeed, her friend Bob does.

> Bob goes all out. Bob makes a new fork with timezones, clock faces, alarms, and timers. Alice posts it on `app://news` and it goes straight to the front page. Your original version doesn't have any users now, but that's ok. Bob got the job done, and now Bob has 300 new followers.

> Of course, Bob's app is a bit much for what you need on the wall, so you never switch. You and 15 other people appear to be happy with the simpler version, with the custom fonts. So, you stay.

> Sometimes, simpler is better anyway.

This is the vision we're pursuing with [Beaker](#todo).
